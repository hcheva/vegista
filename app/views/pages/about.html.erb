      Hello, i'm Henri. Some of my friends are indie game devs. They are good, very good, but many complain about a recurring problem : "How to promote my game???". â€¦ And the most annoying part is that if they don't promote their games, it won't work. To highlight the problem more clearly: <strong>indie games suffer from a lack of visibility </strong>and working weeks may be wiped out due to lack of promotion. 
    </p>

      This affects all indie game developers. Just consult <a href="https://www.quora.com/search?q=promote+indie+game" target="_blank">Quora</a> to realize that this problem is global. 
    </p>

      I'm not telling you that my solution will revolutionize lives, but it's a good start. I created a simple platform to help game creators to get more exposure, <strong>submitting their works to video game enthusiasts</strong> around the world for free.

      I hope it'll help :)
